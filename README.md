I created a Library Relational database containing 6 tables (initially 5 tables). The tables are:
BOOK table: It contains information about the books in our library.
AUTHOR table: It conains the data about the authors of the books in our care.
GENRE table: It helps us to classify the books into Fiction and Nonfiction.
LOAN table: It records cases of books borrowed by the members of the library.
MEMBER tabe: It contains the data about the Library's members.

This Project was in SQL Server code.
The Project contains two files: an Entity Relationship Diagram and a SQL code file. Both are from SQL Server 2022.
